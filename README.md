# wsig - Read and Write RIFF files
____

The wsig module provides a convenient interface to the riff format for physiology measures. 

The wsig module defines the following function and exception:
```python
wsig.open(file, mode=None)
```
If file is a string, open the file by that name, otherwise treat it as a file-like object. mode can be:
* `'rb'`: Read only mode.
* `'wb'`: Write only mode.

A *mode* of 'rb' returns a Wave_read object, while a *mode* of 'wb' returns a Wave_write object. If mode is omitted and a file-like object is passed as file, file.mode is used as the default value for mode.

If you pass in a file-like object, the wave object will not close it when its close() method is called; it is the caller’s responsibility to close the file object.

The `open()` function may be used in a with statement. When the with block completes, the `Wsig_read.close()` or `Wsig_write.close() method is called.

```python
exception wsig.Error
```
An error raised when something is impossible because it violates the RIFF specification or hits an implementation deficiency.

## Wsig_plot
* Wsig_read.**plot()**

Plot the calibrated signal . (`matplotlib` package required)

### List of parameters for calibration
* `Wsig_read._czero` (calibration_at_zero)
* `Wsig_read._signaldynamic` (= calibration_at_max - calibration_at_zero)
* `Wsig_read._valueatmax` (integer_part_of_the_value_at_max + floating_part_x_10^6_of_the_max / 1000000.0)

**Calibration algorithm**
```
double val_calib = (double)(valint16 - czero) * (m_fValueAtMax / m_fSignalDynamic)
```

## Wisg_read Objects
Wsig_read objects, as returned by `open()`, have the following methods:

* Wsig_read.**close()**
Close the stream if it was opened by `wsig`, and make the instance unusable. This is called automatically on object collection.

* Wsig_read.**getnchannels()**
Returns number of audio channels (`1` for mono, `2` for stereo).

* Wsig_read.**getsampwidth()**
Returns sample width in bytes.

* Wsig_read.**getframerate()**
Returns sampling frequency.

* Wsig_read.**getnframes()**
Returns number of audio frames.

* Wsig_read.**getcomptype()**
Returns compression type (`'NONE'` is the only supported type).

* Wsig_read.**getcompname()**
Human-readable version of `getcomptype()`. Usually `'not compressed'` parallels `'NONE'`.

* Wsig_read.**getparams()**
Returns a `namedtuple()` `(nchannels, sampwidth, framerate, nframes, comptype, compname, duration)`, equivalent to output of the `get*()` methods.

* Wsig_read.**readframes(n)**
Reads and returns at most *n* frames of audio, as a *bytes* object.

* Wsig_read.**rewind()**
Rewind the file pointer to the beginning of the audio stream.

The following two methods are defined for compatibility with the aifc module, and don’t do anything interesting.

* Wsig_read.**getmarkers()**
Returns `None`.

* Wsig_read.**getmark(id)**
Raise an error.

The following two methods define a term “position” which is compatible between them, and is otherwise implementation dependent.

* Wsig_read.**setpos(pos)**
Set the file pointer to the specified position.

* Wsig_read.**tell()**
Return current file pointer position.
